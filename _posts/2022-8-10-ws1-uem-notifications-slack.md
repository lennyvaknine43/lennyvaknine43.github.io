title: Send Slack Notifications When Devices Enroll or are Wiped From Workspace One UEM
categories: updates

In a previous job I referenced TaniaComputers excellent blog post for jamf computers reporting when a computer was successfully enrolled via slack notification to a dedicated channel. This was valuable to us and helped on a few occassions with troubleshooting enrollments and other issues. 
At my current job, I wanted to recreate this experience for the Windows platform using WorkspaceOne UEM and Slack to send these notifications. This is the story of my journey.
